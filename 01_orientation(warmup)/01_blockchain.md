## 🌐 Why Blockchains Exist (Big Picture)

### 1️⃣ Inflation & Currency Printing

* Governments print large amounts of money.
* More money in circulation → **inflation**.
* Prices of everyday goods keep rising.
* Holding cash (USD, INR) **loses value over time**.
* Holding assets like **gold, stocks, or real estate** is generally safer long-term.

---

### 2️⃣ Fractional Reserve Banking

* Banks **do not keep all your deposited money**.
* Most of it is lent out.
* If everyone withdraws money at once (**bank run**), banks can’t pay everyone.
* Example: **Silicon Valley Bank collapse (2022)**

  * Many startups had funds stuck there.
  * Government bailout prevented massive startup failures.

---

### 3️⃣ Bailouts & Financial Crises

* **2008 Financial Crisis** was caused by risky financial products (mortgage-backed securities).
* Big banks were responsible but:

  * Governments **bailed them out using taxpayer money**.
* This shows:

  * Profits are private
  * Losses are socialized (paid by public)
* *The Big Short* explains this clearly (recommended movie).

### 4️⃣ Currency Depreciation

* National currencies **lose value over time**.
* INR has depreciated against USD.
* Some countries (e.g., Japan’s JPY) have seen **even worse depreciation**.
* Long-term savings in fiat currencies are risky.

---

### 5️⃣ Fiat Money Is Not Asset-Backed

* Modern currencies are **not backed by gold or real assets**.
* Their value depends mainly on:

  * Trust in government
  * Central bank policies

---

### 6️⃣ Why Creating a New Currency Is Hard

* Traditionally, only **central governments** can issue money.
* If an individual creates a currency:

  * They can print unlimited supply → **no scarcity**
  * They control validation → **centralized power**
  * People have **no reason to trust it**

---

  * Inflation
  * Bailouts
